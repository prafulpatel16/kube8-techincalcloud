--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.rolling deployment strategies

MaxSurge
Im MaxSurge whatever pod value is being given in new replicaset based on that the pods are being created and at the same time the same number of older pods 
are being terminated.


Max Unavailable: 0 and 1
Max Unavailable: 1 - it means the number of pods will be become Unavailable first from an existing replicaset

Max Unavailable: 0 - it means the pods will not be terminated first from existing replicaset.

>Use Case: 1
Max Surge: 2
Max Unavailable: 0

This will create a new pods first from the new replicaset and then terminate the 2 pods from an existing replicaset

>Use Case: 2
Max Surge: 2
Max Unavailable: 1

This will first remove 2 pods from an existing replicaset and then it will create 2 new pods from a new replicaset. so in this Case
there will be some slight downtime can be experienced by user which is not good.


>it can be mentioned % wise as well in Max Surge and Max Unavailable

MAx Surge: 25%
Max Unavailable: 10%



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.recreate

This is just re creating an existing pods from terminating an existing pods so there will be some downtime. so in test environment this can be done
but in prod env this is not a good option.
